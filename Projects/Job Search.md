## Stages

### Clear Introduction

#### Brief Walk Through CV

- I started my career as a Java Backend Developer in 2020, working on healthcare integration projects. We developed small microservices to exchange data between different departments, with no complex interactions between them. Technologies included Spring Boot, REST APIs, schedulers, and Docker.

- I then joined ELG as a Full Stack Developer, where I expanded my skills into frontend development and mentoring junior developers. The backend was built with Spring Boot, and the frontend with Vaadin, using a monolithic architecture. I delivered features such as Excel import and interactive dashboards.
    
- Most recently, I worked at HRS. I began as a backend developer, and my first major task was designing and implementing a notification microservice for our platform. Later, I took on more responsibility with a large federal healthcare integration project. Initially, I coordinated the work of three developers, and eventually led a dedicated healthcare integration team of five. We delivered the project on time, meeting all legal and regulatory requirements. When the healthcare development branch was unexpectedly closed, I decided it was the right moment to look for a new position, already being in Germany.
    
- I’m now seeking a role where I can apply my existing expertise while continuing to grow in the architecture of high-load, large-scale systems.
#### Why are you looking for a new job?

- The healthcare features we developed were used by only a few clients, and the company decided they were not profitable to maintain, so they closed that branch. Since I was already in Germany at that time, I decided to look for a position on the local market.
#### What are your career goals in the next few years?

- To grow into a technical lead or architect role, focusing on designing scalable, high-performing systems and mentoring other developers. Within five-eight years.
