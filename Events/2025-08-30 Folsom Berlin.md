# Description

Folsom Berlin 2025 - фетиш фестиваль.

# Agenda


# Notes

Actually, the festival had started in the beginning of the week, but I was able only to visit the last two days. Maksim had some tickets for two musicals in Berlin, so he had planned to stay there for a night. I took this opportunity to visit Berlin's fetish festival called Folsom.

I met with Kostya and his not-yet boyfriend Sergei. We wandered around for a while in that gay neighbourhood, then ate a doner and then I went to Der Boiler. There I met one very handsome and shy polish bear, who even bought me a beer.

Next year I would love to participate in this event being more prepared. I would love to get dressed together with Maksim and be that one pair everyone having their eyes on.
