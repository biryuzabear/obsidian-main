# Description

Звонок с Юлей и Гохар.

# Agenda


# Notes

I miss them, really much. I'm a little bit sad after the call. I feel like I'm loosing some connection, stay behind. There are a lot of things going in Yerevan, Sveta has married suddenly to stay in the country. And it's about overall feeling. I'm sure they still love us, and we keep having our calls I hope. Maybe I'm just in a bad mood lately. Maybe everything will be nice.
