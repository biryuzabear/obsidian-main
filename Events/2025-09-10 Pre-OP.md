# Description

Предоперационная подготовка в Elblandklinikum Radebeul.

# Agenda


# Notes

- First I had some measurments and analysis
- After that I had a conversation with an anaesthesiologist about anaesthesia. He offered me two options, full or part. I choose the part one but with sedation.
- After that I had a consultation with a doctor who would make an operation. He told me about all risks and asked me to signature a few documents.
- Somehow they managed to confuse the dates. I should have the operation onbe day later, but as for me it was even more convinient to have it earlier.

# Documents

X-Ray - I should scan it but I don't have a CD-reader
