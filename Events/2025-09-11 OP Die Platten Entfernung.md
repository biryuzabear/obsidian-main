# Agenda


# Notes

## September, 11

I got to the clinic about 6 o'clock and after that I waited for a while. I hadn't eaten or drunk anything before. I'd been waiting for about an hour until a nurse asked me to go with the belongings. Then I should have prepared myself, change clothes for the nightgown and very light trousers made of net or kinda. Then I waited again, I was able to sleep for a while. And then about eleven they got me to the surgery room. A very nice nurse made me a sedation injection and then an injection into the spine. Actually, I can't recall this moment at all. Someone told me that it should be very painful but it wasn't. And then almost immediately, as I think, I fell asleep. I woke up already in my room, maybe I had some episodes of conciouysness during the operation and returning to the room, but I can't remember them now. In the room I slept for a while, and then the boy checked my vital signs and during the checking I fainted. I come back to consiousness very fast, I guess. Then I tried not to use any painkillers as long as I can. Maybe it was not the best decision, but I was really interested about how could I feel. It was my remedy against the hypochondria. Well, eventually I had fibber and had no other choice but took them. They made me an infusion(?) of parazetamol. I couldn't sleep until the next day, and couldn't do anything useful as well.

Next day in the morning the doctor visited me and told me about the OP. It seemed that actually the OP had taken more time than they had predicted. Two hours instead of one. He told that it had been really hard to take out the plates. They made me a wound dressing and then I even managed to get to the toilet. Also there was a very nice young nurse man, he really helped me and explained a lot and we just had a lot of nice conversations together.

The doctor told me that I could get back home as soon as I can walk so I decided that the 3rd day would be fine. Anastasia Izmaikova met me and helped to get home, because I was a little bit worried of fainting again. But everything went fine, except we happened to miss a train. We just waited for the next one and had a lot of chit-chats.

## Overall

Overall experience was really good, everyone was so nice to me. And almost everyone speaks English really well.
