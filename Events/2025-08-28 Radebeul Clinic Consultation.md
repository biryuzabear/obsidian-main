# Description

Консультация в Elblandklinikum Radebeul по поводу операции.

# Agenda


# Notes

It was my first consultation with this doctor. I was sent to this clinic by [[Annett Nix]], she gave me a ref. I felt a little bit nervous, because I had decided not to ask for a translator, it's to costly for me. I had prepared, had learned a few special words and therms in German. I guess it helped. The doctor spoke English a little bit, but mostly I tried to use German. I'm kinda proud about this experience.

He made an appointment for me for OP - operation. They are going to remove the metal. And the we will decide if I need any other treatment at this point.
