# Description

Звонок с Олей.

# Agenda


# Notes

When we phoned we thought it would be a short call for an hour - as always it was almost four hours long call. We talked about everything, this is why I really appreciate our friendship. She also motivated me to keep looking for a job. She told about their with Vsevolod situation in which they had been a year before. A lot of people in the USA spent a lot of time to find a job, or you can go for a survival job. I don't want it now. Also as usual talked a lot about relationships.

To be honest, lately I usually feel like it's hard for me to concentrate and deliver my thoughts clearly. Maybe it's because I spend a lot of time thinking about things. Maybe I should have more rest and relax.
