After a short (and much-needed) break, I’m ready to dive back into the (deep) waters of the job search.

I’m Vladimir Fedorchenko, a Java Developer with over 3 years of experience delivering production-ready features in healthcare and accounting systems.

Most recently, I led a full-cycle integration with a federal healthcare platform and designed a doctor notification system that improved real-world workflows.

My background includes:

- Developing applications with Spring and Spring Boot
- Building user interfaces with Vaadin
- Integrating with medical systems and APIs

I’m now actively looking for a new opportunity — ideally as a Java Backend — in Germany (I hold a valid work permit), or in a fully remote position.

If you know of any roles where strong backend expertise, system thinking, and solid communication skills are valued, I’d be grateful for a referral or a quick conversation.

You can reach me here on LinkedIn or via email: vladimir.a.fedorchenko@gmail.com

Thanks in advance for your time and support.
