#### **Objective: Java Developer**

I'm a Java developer with 5 years of experience, mainly in healthcare tech. One of the most important projects I worked on was a federal-level system integration for a client. I led a team of five people through the full process, from planning to launch. It took us a year, though we managed it, delivered everything on time and met all legal requirements.

I have a math background and a lot of experience working with people from my previous career. Thus, I'm both comfortable solving technical problems and participating in calls. Now I’m focused on growing into microservices, system architecture and cloud development.
