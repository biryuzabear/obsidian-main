Dear Hiring Team!

I am applying for the Java Developer position at your company.

I bring almost 5 years of experience in Java development, mostly in healthcare systems. In my latest role at HRS, I led the integration of a hospital platform with a federal healthcare system — a year-long project delivered on time and in full compliance with legal standards. I also designed and built tools such as a doctor notification system, improving operational workflows.

Previously, I worked at ELG, where I developed enterprise accounting systems, created interactive dashboards, and mentored junior developers. My tech stack includes Java, Spring Boot, Vaadin, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, and message queues like Kafka. I write clean, testable code using JUnit, Mockito, and Testcontainers, and I’m experienced in Agile environments with close collaboration across roles.

I’m fluent in English (C1) and speak basic German (A2). I currently live in Riesa and hold a valid German work permit.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to contribute my experience in backend and full-stack development, particularly in systems that have real social and technical impact.

Best regards,
Vladimir Fedorchenko
