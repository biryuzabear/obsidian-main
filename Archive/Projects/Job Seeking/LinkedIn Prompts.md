## Main text + ADD CV

Hi [Name],  
Thanks for accepting my request. I’m a Java developer with 5 years of experience, mainly in healthcare tech.  
One of my key projects was leading a team of five to build a federal-level system - we delivered it on time and fully compliant.

I have a strong math background (bachelor degree), good communication skills, and I’m now focused on microservices, system architecture, and cloud development.

I’m currently looking for a new opportunity in Germany. Please let me know if you’re aware of any relevant positions.  
I’ve attached my CV for your reference.

Thanks in advance!
