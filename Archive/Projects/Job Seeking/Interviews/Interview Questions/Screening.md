### Tell me about yourself

I’m a Java developer with 5 years of experience, mostly in healthcare and accounting systems. I’ve led integration projects at the federal level, worked full-stack, and also mentored junior developers. I enjoy solving complex problems and now I’m focusing on cloud technologies, microservices, and system architecture.

### Why did you leave your previous company?

I worked as a Java developer at HRS while living in Armenia. I was employed as a B2B contractor with self-employed status in Armenia. When I moved to Germany less than half a year ago, we had to part ways. The company wasn’t ready to pay a salary competitive with the local market here, and it was also quite difficult to legalize my income in Germany as a self-employed person. I had completed all important projects there, and since then, I’ve been looking for a new job.

### What are you looking for in your next role?

In my next role, I'm looking for a stable and supportive environment where I can keep growing professionally. I value open communication, the chance to learn from colleagues and real work experience, and being part of a team where people help each other. It’s also important for me to see how my work contributes to the overall goals, and to feel that what I do makes a difference.

### What are your salary expectations?

I would like to earn at least 60,000. Of course, I’m flexible and open to discuss, depending on the role and benefits.

### When can you start?

I’m available to start immediately. If relocation is needed, I would appreciate 1–2 weeks to prepare and move, but overall I’m flexible.
