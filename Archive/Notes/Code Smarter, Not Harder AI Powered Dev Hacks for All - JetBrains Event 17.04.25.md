Here's a cleaned-up and structured version of your notes with organized themes, subpoints, and a **"Technologies to Try"** section pulled from your markings. I’ve also improved the phrasing a bit for clarity. Let me know if you want it turned into a blog post, a talk outline, or something else!

## 💡 The Evolving Role of Developers in the Age of AI

### AI & Developer Roles
- **Will AI replace developers?**
- **More likely:** Developers who use AI will replace those who don’t.
- Developers who can **adapt and learn new skills** will be in high demand.
- Even in the enterprise world, AI is **becoming standard**.
- AI might **bring back the joy** of programming—by offloading repetitive tasks and enabling more creativity.
- The future of software development isn't necessarily scary—some experts are **optimistic**.

### Personal Perspective
- Reflect on: *What do I like and dislike about programming?*
- Can AI help bring back the **creative spark** and joy of being a builder?

## ⚙️ Practical Applications of AI for Developers

### Coding & Learning Support
- **Understanding Code**
  - Read and comprehend code (especially legacy code).
  - Ask questions like: *What is this code trying to solve?* or *Where can this be improved?*
  - Improve **code comprehension** and **reading strategies**.
- **Learning New Concepts**
  - Break down complex topics.
  - Personalized learning paths.
  - Ask for comparisons or summaries of new frameworks, trends, etc.
- **Technical Writing & Documentation**
  - Generate or improve docs.
  - Create sample code, usage examples, and READMEs.
  - Align writing with company or project style guides.
  - Convert technical jargon into plain language.

### Building Tools & Automation
- Create tools to solve repetitive problems (CLIs, IDE plugins, browser extensions).
- **Raycast** plugin example – made for fun using Spring Initializr.
- Explore sites like **Three Observations** to spark tool-building ideas. (actually I guess it is an article, I'm not sure at all now)

### Working with Data
- Transform data formats (e.g., JSON → Java record).
- Spot anomalies or edge cases.
- Design schemas and relationships.
- Optimize or migrate database queries.
- Generate mock/fake data.

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering & Effective AI Usage

### Prompting Best Practices
- Think of it like teaching, not commanding.
- Bad prompts = vague and short. Good prompts = clear, detailed, contextual.
- Structure prompts: from **zero-shot**, to **few-shot**, to **chain-of-thought**.
- Include **examples, desired formats**, and **context**.
- Iterate and refine your prompts—it's part of the process.
- Different AIs need different prompting styles.

### Voice Prompting
- You don’t have to write—talking to AI is like chatting with a colleague.

### Prompting Tools
- **Claude’s Projects** – save and organize your prompts.
- **ChatGPT Prompting Guide** – worth reading for deeper understanding.

## 🧪 Guiding AI Coding Tools (You Are the Pilot)

### Evolution of AI-Assisted Coding
- **Standalone Chat Assistants** (e.g., ChatGPT)
- **Inline IDE Assistants** (e.g., GitHub Copilot, JetBrains AI)
- **Agentic AI IDEs** (e.g., Cursor, Junie, Windsurf)

### Responsible Use
- Don’t blindly trust code.
  - Review & refactor it.
  - Apply testing rigorously.
  - Watch out for outdated info or hallucinations.
  - Understand licenses of generated content.
  - Vibe coding is OK for fun, but not for prod.

## 🔐 Safety, Security, and Ethics

- Be cautious of:
  - **Hallucinations** leading to insecure or broken code.
  - **Biased/inappropriate responses**.
  - **Leaking proprietary code** into public models.
- **Running models locally** for more security/privacy.
