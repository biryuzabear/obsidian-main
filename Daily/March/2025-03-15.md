## Day reflection

### What happened today?

Actually, I just played BG3 all day. I just needed it.

Also, I just remembered that I made a pretty big note about [[Alvar Aalto]], the famous Finnish architect. And after that, I made a [[Modernist Church]]. I hope the list will become bigger over time.
### How do I feel?


### What am I grateful for?


### How am I going to relax now?
