## Day reflection

### What happened today?

Today, Maksim and I visited real estate agencies. It's difficult to say that it was a pleasant experience. At the first place, there was no one, despite their website stating they were open. At the second place, the receptionist looked at us as if we were the worst thing that had happened to her this week. She told us they didn't have any options at the moment, and only when we asked if it would be useful to leave our contact details did she suggest doing so.

The third place was quite nice. Alas, they also didn't have any opportunities for us. So, we decided to go back to that manager, Ina, from the very first agency we had contacted. She told us that the apartment we had visited two weeks ago had already been rented. But she offered us a new one, so we're going to visit it next Wednesday.

The rest of the day was quite usual: I learned German and English, prepared some food, and did the dishes. After that, I finally played Baldur's Gate without feeling like I should be doing something more important instead. Now, I'm going to learn something about databases for my pet project.

### How do I feel?

I don't feel so tired, maybe because I played a game for a while, which made me happier and more energized. Today, I decided to play in the evening when I felt drowsy, and it helped me stay on track. And now, I hope I'll tire myself out a little by studying, so it will be easier for me to go to sleep earlier. I really want to improve my routine.

### What am I grateful for?

I'm grateful for being able to keep working on my routine. I'm even a little proud of myself. I'm grateful for having tasty food and for being able to walk, even though my legs have been feeling really bad recently. I'm grateful for having a husband and for the opportunity to improve our relationship.
