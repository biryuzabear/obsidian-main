## Day Reflection

### What happened today?

Nothing really special happened today. But for the first time since last week, I visited the gym. I don't know the reason, but both of my legs hurt really badly today. Maybe it's somehow related to the weather—I don't know. I hope it will end soon; otherwise, I should do something about it, and I guess I'm not ready.

Also, I can write a little about yesterday. I know I planned to play Baldur's Gate, but suddenly, at midnight, I decided to install Linux on my work laptop. The one that I had stolen, yes. So yesterday, I spent some time figuring out which distribution would fit my needs best. And for now, I'm using [[Kubuntu]].

### How do I feel?

I feel quite tired. Today, I managed to complete everything I had planned, but it cost me a lot of energy. I spent two hours learning English, three hours learning German, and two hours at the gym. And between all these things, I had to feed myself, do the dishes, etc.

### What am I grateful for?

I'm grateful for... I don't know, quite a question. Today, it's hard to be grateful since nothing really special happened, and I'm still tired. Maybe, again, I'm grateful for friends and family. Gohar wrote to me today, I wrote to my mum, and Maksim and I talked a lot about languages. So, let's call it a day and skip to the good part.

### How am I going to relax now?

I'm REALLY going to play Baldur's Gate right now.
