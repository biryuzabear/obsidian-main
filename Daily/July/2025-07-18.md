## Tarot reading

- The Empress
- Death
- Queen of Swords

The first card in the spread — the Empress — is about nourishment, creation, and abundance. The second one — Death — is about letting go of something without apology. The last one — the Queen of Swords — speaks of readiness, clear thinking, and sharp insight.

Together, these cards tell a story of making important decisions — including the readiness to let something go — in order to grow in the future.
