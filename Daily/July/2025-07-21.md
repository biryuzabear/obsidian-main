## Tarot reading

- knight of cups
- two of pentacles
- the emperor

Today's spread could tell us about different things.
The first card is the Knight of Cups. Knights in general speak about movement, and Cups are about feelings. So, today our feelings could be stirred or in motion in some way. For example, today I had a therapy session where we were dealing with a very fragile theme: my relationship with my mother and father—not even so much with them as people, but mostly with my thoughts and feelings from when I was a child.

The second card is about balance in some material sphere. Maybe it's related to my plans to buy some tokens for AI agents or subscribe to SaaS services for automation.

The third card is the Emperor. It's usually about structure, order, and stability in life. I guess it could be telling me to try to be more consistent in my approaches.
