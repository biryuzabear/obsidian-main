## Tarot reading

- Eight of Wands
- Nine of Coins
- Death (reversed)

It's very interesting that I got the reversed Death from the straight-up deck. It was something very unusual. Talking about the reading overall, it can be considered as good. The first card speaks about movement, speed, acceleration, and communication. In the context of having an interview today, it's a very good sign. Especially together with the second card in the spread – the Nine of Coins. This card tells us about self-sufficiency, confidence, rewards, elegance. In the context of the interview, it can suggest to present myself as a capable, independent person who has earned his experience. The last card is the most interesting. By itself, Death is not something bad – it's usually about a new start. But here it's in the reversed position. So it means something prevents me from changing – some inner fears, for example. And I guess it's more advice than a forecast. It's about being more brave and honest. At least, I hope so.
