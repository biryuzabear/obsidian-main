## Tarot reading

- the world
- six of cups
- wheel of fortune

It's interesting, that two of the three cards are about cycles. The World is the last card in the set and it can mean wholeness, closure, completion, fulfillment, or integration. In the context of my new beginning, I consider this a good sign - especially alongside the second card. The Six of Cups speaks about kindness, generosity, nostalgia, and receiving or giving small acts of joy. The last card, The Wheel of Fortune, is about cycles. Together with the previous two, I'd love to interpret it positively overall. It seems to relate to my new start and my efforts to improve my life.
