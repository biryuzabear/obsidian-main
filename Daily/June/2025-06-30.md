- Eight of swords - initial state and challenge
- The Hermit - guidance and internal process
- The Chariot - outcome and action

So, we are going from the state of being trapped in our own minds. I'm experiencing self-imposed restrictions, fears and sense of being tied down.

The solution is to go through the process of looking inward. Introspection, solitude and seeking wisdom from within.

This will lead me to the victory. I will have forward momentum.
